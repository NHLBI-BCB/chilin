The ChiLin --- ChIP-seq Data quality and Analysis Pipeline
===========================================================

Introduction
-----------------

* ChIP-seq experiment has been a mature and wide-spread technique for detecting the TF, histone modification and chromatin factors distribution on the genome scale.
* Along with the popularity of the technique and the increasingly huge number of highthroughput datasets, it may be confusing for biologists to get a quick and easy access to understand their biological meaning, and the same important thing is the unbiased judgement of the data quality. So, it's necessary for us to establish a universal and user-friendly ChIP-seq data analysis pipeline for biologists.
* For bioinformaticians, this is one of the most extensible and flexible ChIP-seq implemented with python so far. It support various genomic data format and integrate high-rated analysis toolbox.

**Features**

There are two commands for the pipeline. The new version ChiLin_ provides a more flexible handle for understanding the ChIP-seq analysis workflow. ChiLin_ is part of the Cistrome_ project.
