\part{Basic mapping QC statistics}
We draw the cumulative percentage plot of the mappability rate of all historic data and show how your new data compare.(Figure: ~\ref{fig:mappinratio}).
The mappability rate is defined by the number of aligned reads divided by the number of total reads.  In this plot, the x axis is the mappable rates and the y axis represents the percentage of this mappable rate among all the data. Three color range represent good, medium, and bad quality region.
