\subsection*{Figure: Conservation Clustering results}
Conserved sequences are similar or identical sequences across species, which have been maintained by evolution.  Therefore, highly conserved sequences are thought to relate to functions conserved by evolution.  We plot the average sequence conservation score of your factor binding sites within an window (TF: 500bp up and downstream; Histone: 2000bp up and downstream).  The blue-plot shows the average sequence conservation score over the same window for a datasets which we chose from our historical data as ``matches'' to your data (i.e. ``compared group''.  (Figure ~\ref{fig:conservation_compare}) \newline
