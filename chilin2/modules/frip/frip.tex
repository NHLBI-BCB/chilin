\section*{FRiP}
FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks), is a quality measure for ChIP-Seq and Dnase-Seq experiments.  FRiP is simply the percentage of all tags that fall in 'hotspots', regions of local enrichment of short-read sequence tags mapped to the genome, i.e. MACS peaks.  FRiP scores are positively correlated with true positive rates and replicate reproducibility.
